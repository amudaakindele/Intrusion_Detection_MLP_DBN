# Intrusion Detection using an Ensemble of MLP and Deep Belief Neural Network

This repository contains Python code for Intrusion Detection using an Ensemble of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Deep Belief Neural Network (DBN) with the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is a network traffic dataset that contains different types of attacks (e.g. DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) and normal traffic.
